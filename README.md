This is yet another emacs configuration among countless alternatives.
I would not claim for it to be any better than any other configuration,
and indeed it won't even work for you as-is because this repository
does not include any third-party packages that I use. For now its
just pile of elisp code, but if you feel adventurous you might
find a few interesting bits here.
