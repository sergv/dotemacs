;;; Commentary:

;; Vim-mode motions can be defined with the macro vim-defmotion.
;; Similar to commands motions have several keyword-like optional
;; parameters and a view attributes. The general form is as follows.
;;
;;   (vim-defmotion motion-name ((count [count-name])
;;                               (argument [argument-name])
;;                               {inclusive,exclusive,linewise,block})
;;     body ...)
;;
;; The count and argument parameters are optional and can have a
;; special variable-name. Exactly one of the attributes inclusive,
;; exclusive, linewise, block must be specified.
;;
;; count: The number of times the motion should be repeated.
;;
;; argument: An extra character argument to be given after the motion
;;           command has been initiated. Examples are the motions f F
;;           t T of Vim.
;;
;; inclusive, exclusive, linewise, block: This is the default motion
;;                                        type of this motion command.
;;
;; Each motion command should return an object of type vim:motion \(see
;; below\). If the function does not return such an object explicitly,
;; it is automatically created implicitly based on the position of
;; (point) before and after execution of the motion and the specified
;; motion-type. This means when a motion is called from lisp code it
;; returns *always* a vim:motion object.
;;
;; For more information about the vim:motion struct and motion types
;; look at vim-core.el.

;;; Code:

;; TODO:
;;   - should motions that do not change point automatically (ding)?
;;     this is not true in general, e.g., t
;;   - alternatively operator pending mode could never ding, but then
;;     all motions have to be valid even in case of erros
