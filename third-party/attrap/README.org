* Attrap: Emacs mode to fix the flycheck error at point

Attrap! provides a command to attempt to fix the flycheck error at point.

Invoke the command ~attrap-attrap~ when point is on a flycheck error,
and check the results.  Attrap! currently comes with fixers for
~haskell-dante~ and ~emacs-lisp~. Support for other flycheck
checkers can be added dynamically (see ~attrap.el~).

Installation with ~use-package~:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package attrap
  :ensure t
  :bind (("C-x /" . attrap-attrap))) ;; use any binding of your choice
#+END_SRC

** Note for GHC users

Attrap assumes that GHC outputs unicode symbols in error messages,
which will happen only if $LANG is set to a proper value, such as

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 
#+END_SRC
