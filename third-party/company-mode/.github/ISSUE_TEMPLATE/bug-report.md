#### Output of the command `M-x company-diag`
Before posting, look carefully at the output of this command.
You may find important clues in it for figuring out the cause of the issue.

In particular, note the value on the line starting with `Used backend:`
- Compare the value to the names of the [third-party backends](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/wiki/Third-Party-Packages).
  -  It's likely that the issue should be reported to the corresponding third-party package instead.
- If the value is `company-capf`, then one more clue is on the line starting with `Value of c-a-p-f:`
  -  The issue could have been caused by a function listed there.
  -  Use `M-x find-function RET <function-name> RET` to identify which package it belongs to.
