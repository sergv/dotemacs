graphviz-dot-mode
=====================

[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) package for working with
[Graphviz](https://graphviz.org) DOT-format files.

The features of this package help you to create `.dot` or `.gv` files
containing syntax compatible with Graphviz and use Graphviz to convert
these files to diagrams. [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org) is a set of
open source graph visualization tools created by AT&T Labs Research. A
graph is a way of representing information as a network of connected
nodes (shapes) and edges (lines).

Installing
============

Dependencies
--------------

This of course depends on Emacs and Graphviz. Installation from the
command prompt should be something like

``` shell
$ sudo dnf install emacs graphviz
```

Setting up MELPA
-------------------

Add the [MELPA](https://melpa.org/) archive to the list of archives
used by the Emacs package manager by adding the following lines to
your `.emacs` or other Emacs start-up file.

``` emacs-lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
```
Evaluate above code or restart Emacs.

Setting up use-package
---------------------------

Add the [`use-package`](https://jwiegley.github.io/use-package/)
package to your Emacs by adding the following lines to your start-up
file.

``` emacs-lisp
(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'use-package))
```
Evaluate above code or restart Emacs.
	  
Setting up graphviz-dot-mode
----------------------------------

Now you can finally add Graphviz support to your Emacs by adding the
following lines to your start-up file.

``` emacs-lisp
(use-package graphviz-dot-mode
  :ensure t
  :config
  (setq graphviz-dot-indent-width 4))

(use-package company-graphviz-dot
  )
```
Evaluate above code or restart Emacs.

Using `graphviz-dot-mode`
==============================

Once installation and setup is completed, usage is as simple as
creating or opening a `.dot` file with `C-x C-f` (`find-file`). The
file will open in dot mode.  Syntax should be highlighted, completion
should work and viewing your work is only one keystroke away with `C-c
C-p`. Some useful commands are described below.

### Indenting

* `C-M-q` (`graphviz-dot-indent-graph`)

  This command will indent the graph, digraph, or subgraph at point
and any subgraph within it.

* `TAB`

  This key will automatically indent the line.

### Completion

Completion makes use of
[company-mode](http://company-mode.github.io/):

* `company-complete`

  This command will complete the attribute or value keyword at
point. If more than one completion is possible, a list with
suggestions is displayed.

### Commenting

* `M-;` (`comment-dwim`)

  This command will perform the comment command you want (Do What I
Mean).  If the region is active and `transient-mark-mode` is on, it
will comment the region, unless it only consists of comments, in which
case it will un-comment the region. Else, if the current line is
empty, it will insert a blank comment line, otherwise it will append a
comment to the line and indent it.

  Use `C-u M-;` to kill the comment on the current line.

* `C-x C-;` (`comment-line`)

  This command will comment or un-comment the current line.

* `M-j` (`comment-indent-newline`)

  This command will break line the at point and indent, continuing a
comment if within one. This indents the body of the continued comment
under the previous comment line.

### Compiling

* `C-c C-c` (`compile`)
  
  This command compiles the current dot file visited by the Emacs
buffer.  The output file is in the same directory and has the
extension determined by the variable `graphviz-dot-preview-extension`.

* `` C-x ` `` (`next-error`)

  This command will jump to the location in the source file of the
next error from the most recent compile. Use `C-c c` to compile first.

### Viewing

* `C-c C-p` (`graphviz-dot-preview`)
  
  This command compiles and then (if it compiled successfully) shows
the output of the current dot file visited by the Emacs buffer,
provided that Emacs is running on a graphical display capable of
displaying the graphic file output by `dot`.

  See `image-file-name-extensions` to customize the graphic files that
  can be displayed.

* `C-c v` (`graphviz-dot-view`)

  This command invokes an external viewer specified by the variable
`graphviz-dot-view-command`. If `graphviz-dot-view-edit-command` is
`t`, you will be prompted to enter a new
`graphviz-dot-view-command`. If `graphviz-dot-save-before-view` is
`t`, the buffer is saved before the external viewer command is
invoked.

  See <https://graphviz.gitlab.io/resources/> for a list of Graphviz
  viewers.


Customizing
=============

You may customize variables by typing

`M-x graphviz-dot-customize RET`

or by setting them to different values in your start-up file.

* `graphviz-dot-dot-program` string, default: “dot”

  This variable determines the command name (and path, if necessary)
used to invoke the Graphviz `dot` program. The `C-c C-c` (`compile`)
function invokes this command.

* `graphviz-dot-preview-extension` string, default “png”

  This variable determines the file extension used for the `C-c C-c`
(`compile`) and `C-c C-p` (`graphviz-dot-preview`) functions. The
format for the compile command is

  `dot -T<extension> <filename>.dot > <filename>.<extension>`

* `graphviz-dot-save-before-view` boolean, default `t`

  This variable controls whether the buffer will be saved to the
visited file before the `C-c C-v` (`graphviz-dot-view`) function
invokes the external dot-file viewer command. Set this boolean
variable to `t` (true) or `nil` (false).

* `graphviz-dot-view-command` string, default: “dotty %s”

  This variable determines the command name (and path, if necessary)
used to invoke an external dot-file viewer program. The `C-c C-v`
(`graphviz-dot-view`) function invokes this command. The name of the
file visited by the buffer will be substituted for `%s` in this
string.

  See <https://graphviz.gitlab.io/resources/> for a list of Graphviz
viewers.

* `graphviz-dot-view-edit-command` boolean, default: `nil`

  This variable controls whether you will be prompted for the external
dot-file viewer command name when you use `C-c C-v`
`graphviz-dot-view`.  Set this to `t` (true) to be prompted to edit
the viewer command variable `graphviz-dot-view-command` every time you
use `C-c C-v` or `nil` to avoid the prompt.

* `graphviz-dot-indent-width` integer, default: `default-tab-width`

  This variable determines the indentation used in `graphviz-dot-mode`
buffers.

* `graphviz-dot-mode-hook` list of functions, default: `nil`

  This variable determines which functions are called when
`graphviz-dot-mode` starts. To use it, add a line like below to your
`.emacs` or other startup file.

``` emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'graphviz-dot-mode-hook 'my-hook)
```
