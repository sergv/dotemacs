;; Path to Java executable. If it is added to environmental PATH,
;; you don't have to write this.
(setq lsp-latex-java-executable "/path/to/java")

;; "texlab.jar" must be located at a directory contained in `exec-path'
;; "texlab" must be located at a directory contained in `exec-path'.
(setq lsp-latex-texlab-jar-file 'search-from-exec-path)
;; If you want to put "texlab.jar" somewhere else,
;; you can specify the path to "texlab.jar" as follows:
;; (setq lsp-latex-texlab-jar-file "/path/to/texlab.jar")
```
