* v4.2.0    2025-01-01

- At least Git 2.25.0 is required now.  033a0c0cdc

- At least Emacs 27.1 is required now.  c1a86066e8

Bug fixes:

- Fixed a regression in ~transient-init-value~.  5b4c4aea1b

- Fixed setting ~fill-paragraph-function~ in
  ~git-commit-setup-changelog-support~.  139e0fcff3

- ~magit-log-refresh~ lacked the ~--since~ and ~--until~ arguments, which
  were already available in ~magit-log~.  3ecebe8d11

- Enabling verbose output in ~magit-commit-absorb~ caused an error.
  #5272

- In logs, no longer strip ~heads/~ prefix from branch names if a tag
  with the same name exists.  5cb3492464

- ~magit-list-special-refnames~ returned nonsense.  #5277

* v4.1.3    2024-12-06

- For most important sections, if an error occurs while inserting the
  section, the error message is now displayed in the section body.
  #5255

- ~magit-submodule-populate~ now supports ~--recursive~.  #5191 #5256

- Improved ~magit-process-password-prompt-regexps~.  #5257

Bug fixes:

- ~magit-stash-pop~ and ~magit-stash-apply~ sometimes installed conflicts
  for the user to resolve that are more complicated than they need to
  be.  #5253

- ~magit-stash-push~ placed ~--~ before other arguments.  #5260

- ~magit-autorevert~ failed to require ~magit-process~.  #5263

* v4.1.2    2024-11-02

- Add various minor process logging improvements:
  5b30c05d3a magit--git-insert: Collapse process section if appropriate
  b11524120e magit--git-insert: Optionally always log to process buffer
  cd6cf89d6a Use different face for debug-only process sections
  bba06845de magit-process-insert-section: Improve file-path comparison
  f2a6133443 magit-run-git-async: No longer clutter ~*Messages*~ buffer

Bug fixes:

- If the left margin was in use before ~magit-blame-mode~ started using
  that margin, then the old width was not restored when the mode was
  disabled.  #5236

- Prior to Tramp being loaded, setting ~magit-tramp-pipe-stty-settings~
  to ~nil~ resulted in an error, due to ~tramp-pipe-stty-settings~ not
  being bound yet.  #5240

- ~magit-copy-section-value~ no longer did anything for most section
  types.  #5244.

- Global git arguments often got added twice to the list of arguments
  ultimately passed to git.  914285a5e8

- Inserting the headers of status buffers involves temporary changes
  to ~magit-insert-section-hook~.  These changes were not restricted to
  the current buffer, causing errors when ~magit-git-debug~ is enabled
  and we thus insert sections in the process buffer, while the status
  buffer is being refreshed.  11e13640c4

- Some ~git~ errors were not logged despite ~magit-git-debug~ being
  enabled.  874fb0fede

- ~magit-browse-thing~ and ~magit-visit-thing~ tried to turn anything
  at point into an URL.  Now the bail if there is no URL at point.

  whose body is not inserted until the expansion takes place.
  9395de2c94

- Addressed an incompatibility with Eglot.  #5226

- Adapted to a change in ~define-globalized-minor-mode~ in Emacs 30,
  which caused ~diff-hl-mode~ to be enabled in blob buffers.  #5229

- When adding the commit at point to the completion defaults, it was
  assumed that ~minibuffer-default-add-function~ cannot be nil.
  6d0075f523

- ~magit-blame--format-string-1~ didn't handle a list of faces
  correctly.  5395798301

  #5102

- Updated tooling and other housekeeping.

Bug fixes:

- Only use an explicit range in ~magit-insert-recent-commits~, when also
  using ~--graph~.  With ~--graph~ it increases performance noticeably,
  but without it decreases performance somewhat.  #5075

- ~magit-completing-read-multiple~ now shows the default choice in the
  prompt, if a completion framework is used, for which that is useful.
  #5205.
