* Magit v3.1.0 Release Notes

Released 1st July 2021 by Jonas Bernoulli.

I am pleased to announce the release of Magit version 3.1.0,
representing 31 commits by 4 contributors over one month.

** Breaking changes

- The function signature of ~magit-completing-read-multiple~ was not
  compatible with that of ~completing-read-multiple~, so we deprecate
  it.  Use the improved ~magit-completing-read-multiple*~ instead.
  #4420

- The description of ~magit-merge-into~ in the merge menu was changed
  to "dissolve" (from "merge into").  In the future we are going to
  change the key binding from "i" to "d" as well, to keep it mnemonic.
  We don't make both changes at once in the hope that this makes the
  transition easier for existing users.  4c096921f

** Changes since v3.0.0

- Adjusted to changes to Eieio in Emacs 28.  a3626277c, 54a0019f3

- Added new command ~magit-log-move-to-revision~.  #4418

- ~A m~ is now also bound to ~magit-merge-squash~.  Despite the name it
  fits better there.  51152fdec

** Fixes since v3.0.0

- Fixed ~magit-emacs-Q-command~ and ~make build~ for ELPA users.
  f50c3aa56

- Fixed reading choice in ~magit-process-git-credential-manager-core~.
  #4396

- ~magit-blame~ didn't account for quoted file names when parsing
  output from ~git blame~.  #4400

- A regression in v3.0.0 prevented ~magit-bisect-run~ from executing
  ~git bisect run~ unless ~magit-bisect-start~ was called beforehand.
  f592e367d

- ~magit-log-select-quit~ failed to call ~magit-log-select-quit-function~.
  #4423

- The entry for pull-requests in ~magit-list-refs-namespaces~ did not
  match the ref names used by Forge for that purpose.  4c3373f9a
