* Magit v3.2.1 Release Notes

Released 6st August 2021 by Jonas Bernoulli.

I am pleased to announce the release of Magit version 3.2.1.

This is the first release that is available from NonGNU Elpa.  It is
identical to version 3.2.0 except for dependency metadata, which had
to be changed so that this package could be released on NonGNU Elpa.
