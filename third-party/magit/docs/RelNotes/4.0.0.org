* Magit v4.0.0 Release Notes

Released 8th August 2024 by Jonas Bernoulli.

I am pleased to announce the release of Magit version 4.0.0,
representing 1077 commits by 69 contributors over three years.

Also see https://emacsair.me/2024/08/09/magit-4.0.

** Breaking changes

- Dropped support for Emacs 25.  7c794201c4

- Removed several functions, variables and variable values that were obsoleted
  in past releases:
  - bc18ba942f Removed ~git-commit-fill-column~, obsolete since v2.11.0
  - 6b4f7f5811 Removed ~magit-section-when~, obsolete since v2.90.0
  - a8c92cc35d Removed face aliases, obsolete since v2.12.0 and v3.0.0
  - ed8067830f Removed variables and functions obsolete since v3.3.0
  - 553968346d Removed support for obsolete ~magit-branch-rename-push-target~ values
  - b47efecfe6 Removed support for obsolete %-sequence in ~magit-branch-name-format~

- Removed library ~magit-libgit.el~, which was only a proof-of-concept, without
  Magit actually making use of it.  Packagers were discouraged from including
  this library in the Magit package, but many disregarded that.  Because that
  caused issues for many users, it had to be removed.  c9fd81217c, 703dfe5812

- Completed the switch to a new ~magit-completing-read-multiple~ implementation.

** Changes since v3.3.0

- Added many context menus, which can be invoked using the mouse or a key
  (~menu~ by default) and are a great way to discover context sensitive commands.
  Context menus were added in Emacs 28.1 and are disabled by default.  Enable
  ~context-menu-mode~ or set ~magit-section-show-context-menu-for-emacs<28~ to ~t~,
  if you are still using an older release.  [[https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/4645][#4645]]

- The menu-bar menu, which was severely neglected for many years, finally got a
  makeover.  It no longer offers a completely random subset of Magit's features.
  Now it can be used to invoke most of the commands that could also be invoked
  using ~magit-dispatch~; but by means of a small furry animal.  5641d3749c

- Rewrote Imenu support, which resulted in a few new features and much less
  code.  4727dcbe22 ff

- Move imenu and bookmark support to the independently distributed ~magit-section~
  package, so that it can be used by third-party packages, without having to
  depend on the ~magit~ package.  [[https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/5104][#5104]]

- One does not simply change key bindings; at least not as a package maintainer.
  ~magit-define-global-key-bindings~ used to be a boolean, now it can be set to
  ~recommended~, to opt in to new easier top-level bindings, which do not require
  changing modifiers mid-sequence.  8b1f599de4

- For the longest time (which is why I don't consider this a bug fix) toggling
  a section caused point to move to the beginning of that section.  Stop doing
  that, unless absolutely necessary.  9d8d5e5603

- Added support for displaying errors that occur when washing a section.
  Use that for diff and log buffers, so users can investigate what went wrong.
  78a979fde5, 2bd3db69d6, d05b1ed381, a760dd1078

- Massively reduced the expansion of the essential macro ~magit-insert-section~,
  moving most work to new support functions. [[https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/5130][#5130]] 13e4422584..058ca81497,
  ee6fbba360..e2ca80a26e, 3695493ce8..f7cba11588

- Avoid expensive and/or unnecessary work, including:

  - ff4710afa6 Deprecate magit-git-dir to avoid needlessly repeating work

  - d536ef9e21 Don't preserve visibility in log buffers
  - Limit use of log graphs and signature verification.  545a64c3ee, e32cec06a4
  - d73a3b11db Record child sections in reverse in log buffers
  - 6014320c3e magit-module-confirm: Use refresh cache
  - fef45b274e magit-insert-child-count: Minor performance tweak
  - 4ec4d0272e magit-insert-section--finish: Optimize propertizing leaf sections
  - 54d969b62f magit-insert-section--finish: Optimize for leaf sections
  - 5544bac955 magit-insert-section--finish: Avoid unnecessary work for root section
  - ~magit-turn-on-auto-revert-mode-if-desired~ performs cheaper checks first now.
    [[https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/4591][#4591]]
  - For performance reasons the "margin" style sadly had to be removed from
    ~magit-blame-styles~.  608242086e

  (menu) [[https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/4810][#4810]], ~git-commit-search-message-backward~ and
  ~git-commit-search-message-forward~ [[https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/4537][#4537]], ~git-rebase-update-ref~ [[https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/4776][#4776]],

  - Added new transient menu ~magit-sparse-checkout~, which provides an interface
    to the ~git sparse-checkout~ command, introduced in Git v2.25.  [[https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/4102][#4102]]

  - Added new command ~magit-clone-sparse~, which makes it possible to clone

    files to be stashed.  [[https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/4583][#4583]]

  - Added new command ~magit-ediff-resolve-all~, an alternative to

    new option ~magit-ediff-dwim-resolve-function~ controls which is used by
    ~magit-ediff-dwim~ (another new command, ~magit-git-mergetool~, can also be
    used).  [[https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/4348][#4348]]
