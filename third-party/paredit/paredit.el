;;; Install paredit by placing `paredit.el' in `/path/to/elisp', a
;;; directory of your choice, and adding to your .emacs file:
;;;
;;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/elisp")
;;;   (autoload 'enable-paredit-mode "paredit"
;;;     "Turn on pseudo-structural editing of Lisp code."
;;;     t)
;;;
;;; Start Paredit Mode on the fly with `M-x enable-paredit-mode RET',
;;; or always enable it in a major mode `M' (e.g., `lisp') with:
;;;
;;;   (add-hook 'M-mode-hook 'enable-paredit-mode)
;;;
;;; Customize paredit using `eval-after-load':
;;;
;;;   (eval-after-load 'paredit
;;;     '(progn
;;;        (define-key paredit-mode-map (kbd "ESC M-A-C-s-)")
;;;          'paredit-dwim)))
;;;
;;; Send questions, bug reports, comments, feature suggestions, &c.,
;;; via email to the author's surname at mumble.net.
;;;
;;; Paredit should run in GNU Emacs 21 or later and XEmacs 21.5.28 or
;;; later.

;;; The paredit minor mode, Paredit Mode, binds common character keys,
;;; such as `(', `)', `"', and `\', to commands that carefully insert
;;; S-expression structures in the buffer:
;;;
;;;   ( inserts `()', leaving the point in the middle;
;;;   ) moves the point over the next closing delimiter;
;;;   " inserts `""' if outside a string, or inserts an escaped
;;;      double-quote if in the middle of a string, or moves over the
;;;      closing double-quote if at the end of a string; and
;;;   \ prompts for the character to escape, to avoid inserting lone
;;;      backslashes that may break structure.
;;;
;;; In comments, these keys insert themselves.  If necessary, you can
;;; insert these characters literally outside comments by pressing
;;; `C-q' before these keys, in case a mistake has broken the
;;; structure.
;;;
;;; These key bindings are designed so that when typing new code in
;;; Paredit Mode, you can generally type exactly the same sequence of
;;; keys you would have typed without Paredit Mode.
;;;
;;; Paredit Mode also binds common editing keys, such as `DEL', `C-d',
;;; and `C-k', to commands that respect S-expression structures in the
;;; buffer:
;;;
;;;   DEL deletes the previous character, unless it is a delimiter: DEL
;;;        will move the point backward over a closing delimiter, and
;;;        will delete a delimiter pair together if between an open and
;;;        closing delimiter;
;;;
;;;   C-d deletes the next character in much the same manner; and
;;;
;;;   C-k kills all S-expressions that begin anywhere between the point
;;;        and the end of the line or the closing delimiter of the
;;;        enclosing list, whichever is first.
;;;
;;; If necessary, you can delete a character, kill a line, &c.,
;;; irrespective of S-expression structure, by pressing `C-u' before
;;; these keys, in case a mistake has broken the structure.
;;;
;;; Finally, Paredit Mode binds some keys to complex S-expression
;;; editing operations.  For example, `C-<right>' makes the enclosing
;;; list slurp up an S-expression to its right (here `|' denotes the
;;; point):
;;;
;;;   (foo (bar | baz) quux)  C-<right>  (foo (bar | baz quux))
;;;
;;; Some paredit commands automatically reindent code.  When they do,
;;; they try to indent as locally as possible, to avoid interfering
;;; with any indentation you might have manually written.  Only the
;;; advanced S-expression manipulation commands automatically reindent,
;;; and only the forms that they immediately operated upon (and their
;;; subforms).
;;;
;;; This code is written for clarity, not efficiency.  It frequently
;;; walks over S-expressions redundantly.  If you have problems with
;;; the time it takes to execute some of the commands, let me know.

;;; This assumes Unix-style LF line endings.
